# Cellular Automata Demo
A janky python implementation of cellular automata.

The code is not perfect, and just a little personal project.

The GUI is hard-coded to match a 1440p screen, and won't work properly on a smaller resolution. To fix this, you can either manually adjust all pixel locations to match your resolution, or change the resolution which your OS thinks your screen is (in NVIDA control panel or similar). I am working on a solution to adjust everything based on your resolution.
